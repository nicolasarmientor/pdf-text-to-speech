## Pricing
This app uses OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API with the gpt-4o-mini-tts model. Pricing is based on the length of fenerated audio:

| Model            | Price per minute of audio |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| gpt-4o-mini-tts  | $0.015 / minute           |
| gpt-4o-tts       | $0.030 / minute           |

- Short phrases like "This is a test" costs less than $0.001.
- A 5-minute audio file with gpt-4o-mini-tts costs $0.075.
- Costs are billed to your OpenAI account after free trial credits are used.

## Development Notes
- Backend (FastAPI + OpenAI TTS integration + Python logic): Mostly implemented by me, with limited enhancements generated by AI (GPT-5).
- HTML templates: Structure written by me with styling inspired by previous projects and minor adjustments assisted by AI (GPT-5).
- CSS styling: Fully AI-generated (GPT-5) and integrated into the project by me.
- PDF text extraction: Implemented by me using pypdf for simplicity, with an option to improve using more rigorous libraries capable of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
